    "## Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "We are excited to have you participate in this workshop, designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice in advanced machine learning, focusing on neural networks, transformers, and computer vision. Through hands-on coding exercises and theoretical discussions, you will gain both foundational and advanced knowledge, enabling you to tackle real-world problems in fields such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision.\n",
